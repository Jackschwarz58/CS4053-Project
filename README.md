# 3D Music Visualizer 

## What
This is our teams first unity project. The goal is to use Geometric shapes (sphere, pyramid, cubes, etc) in a 3 dimensional space as well as physics to create
a graphically interesting display of music for a user. As Shapes fall from spawners and colide with the geometry of the scene and eachother they will change 
color, dispell light, and make a sound. All of this with the hopes to achieve an interesting way to visualize musical elements in a graphics focused way
